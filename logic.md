📄 Algorithm to Estimate Wind Direction and Tack from GPS Track
Input
A sequence of GPS track points in the format:

xml
Copy
Edit
<trkpt lat="54.448913" lon="18.581427">
  <time>2025-05-31T08:31:01.400Z</time>
</trkpt>
Each point has:

lat: latitude in decimal degrees

lon: longitude in decimal degrees

time: timestamp in ISO8601 format

Goal
👉 Estimate:

Wind direction (where the wind is coming from)

Tack at each point:

port tack → wind from the left

starboard tack → wind from the right

Algorithm Steps
1️⃣ Compute the course between each pair of points
For each consecutive pair of points (A, B):

Convert lat/lon from degrees to radians

Compute the bearing (course) from A to B:

bearing=atan2(sin(Δλ)⋅cosϕ 
B
​
 ,cosϕ 
A
​
 ⋅sinϕ 
B
​
 −sinϕ 
A
​
 ⋅cosϕ 
B
​
 ⋅cos(Δλ))
​
 

Convert result to degrees and normalize to [0, 360).

2️⃣ Smooth the course data
Apply moving average or median filter to reduce noise.

This helps eliminate small steering adjustments or GPS jitter.

3️⃣ Detect tacking pattern
Check if the smoothed course alternates between left and right of a central axis → this indicates tacking.

Calculate the average direction of tacks → this is the approximate upwind direction.

4️⃣ Estimate wind direction
If tacking detected:

Wind direction = average tacking axis + 180° (the wind comes from opposite to the average heading)

If no tacking:

Assume wind comes roughly opposite to the dominant heading

5️⃣ Determine tack for each point
For each smoothed course value:

Compute:

relative angle
=
(
wind direction
−
course
+
360
)
%
360
relative angle=(wind direction−course+360)%360
If relative angle < 180°: port tack (wind on the left)

If relative angle > 180°: starboard tack (wind on the right)

Edit
1️⃣ Parse GPX or XML points
2️⃣ Calculate bearings between points
3️⃣ Apply smoothing (e.g. window size 5)
4️⃣ Analyze course pattern for tacking
5️⃣ Infer wind direction
6️⃣ Assign tack for each point
7️⃣ (Optional) Visualize or export results
Notes
⚠ This method provides an approximate wind direction:

Assumes no strong current influence

Assumes no downwind tacking (gybing)

✅ Works best for upwind sailing or windsurfing where clear tacking patterns are present.
